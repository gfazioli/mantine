## Usage

`Flip` component is a wrapper for any component that can be flipped. It is used to create cards, flip boxes and more.

<Demo data={FlipDemos.configurator} />

## Flip.Target

`Flip.Target` should be used as a wrapper for the button that triggers flip animation. It should be placed inside `Flip` component. 

<Demo data={FlipDemos.usage} />

> `Flip.Target` component children should be an element or a component that accepts ref. Fragments, strings, numbers and other primitive values are not supported.

## Controlled

<Demo data={FlipDemos.controlled} />

## Uncontrolled

For uncontrolled flip, you may set the `defaultFlipped` prop to `true` or `false` to set the initial state of the flip.

<Demo data={FlipDemos.flipped} />

## Flip children

`Flip` always has two children. First child is the front side of the flip and the second child is the back side of the flip.

The below example won't work because `Flip` has more than two children.

```tsx
<Flip>
    Hello
    <p>second child</p>
</Flip>
```
